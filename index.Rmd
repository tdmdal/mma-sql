    * [Learning SQL Programming by Scott Simpson](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-sql-programming){target="_blank"} (1h 27m) (login from [here](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/linkit/lyndacom-online-courses){target="_blank"} using UTORid for free access).

2. During the workshop, we will practise SQL together using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/){target="_blank"}, so please make sure you have a Google account.

### Slides

* Intro to SQL ([sql_bootcamp.pdf](sql_bootcamp.pdf))

### Notebook

### Backup Setup

If you don't have access to Google service, below is a backup setup for the workshop.

1. Install [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html){target="_blank"} and [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/){target="_blank"}. You should already have it installed if you took the online course by Scott Simpson (see Prerequisite above).

2. Download the dataset ([northwind.sqlite3](data/northwind.sqlite3)).

### SQL Setup for RSM8411 (MMA, Fall 2020)

You will learn more SQL in RSM8411 this fall. Instead of SQLite as we use in this workshop, RSM8411 will use Microsoft SQL Server Express. Please make sure you have it installed and tested before the end of this workshop. If you encounter any problem setting it up, please let me know.

* Download and install [Microsoft SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads){target="_blank"}, a mini-versin of MS SQL Server (<span style="color: red;">important:</span> download the **Express** version).

* Download and install [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms){target="_blank"} (SSMS), A GUI management client for MS SQL Server.

* Test the installation (I will walk you through this step in the workshop).
    * Download and restore the [Northwind Database](northwind.bak).
    * Execute a few SQL statements.

* Getting-stated resources: [Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2019](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/querying-microsoft-sql-server-2019){target="_blank"} (login from [here](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/linkit/lyndacom-online-courses){target="_blank"} using UTORid for free access).

In addition, to be well prepared for RSM8411, please go through [this SQL tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/){target="_blank"} at w3schools. The tutorial provides a good review of SQL syntax.
